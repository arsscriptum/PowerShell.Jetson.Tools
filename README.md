# PowerShell.Jetson.Tools

This repository contains all my personal powershell scripts that I created while developing on the [Nvidia Jetson TK1](https://elinux.org/Jetson_TK1) development kit.

## Tools and 	Description

 - [App's StdOUT/StdERR Parser and Data Extractor](apt-get.errors.parser) : errors outputed when running ```apt-get``` can be parsed to retrieved the list of local packages causing issues.  
 - [Jetson Develoment Resources Organizer](devkit.packages.parser) : development [packages](https://developer.nvidia.com/embedded/jetpack-archive) provided on ```https://developer.nvidia.com/``` contains various different files that we need. Use this tool to automatically download and organize the required files while keeping a catalog of assets for future references.
 - [Jetson Toolchain Manager](toolchain.version.manager) : my own custom solution to automate the toolchain's packages version management. ***IN PROGRESSS***
